The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after m y assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth'),\n",

Recently, during my address to the agricultural \\nscientists while participating in a National Symposium on “Agri culture Cannot Wait”, I \\nsummarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers. W e have to double the \\nagricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and re duced \\nmanpower and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle  of \\n“Seed to Food” since agriculture is the backbone of the nation. We should em power the \\nfarmers to protect and nurture the fertile land for second green re volution.

His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mi nd. He introduced himself \\nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him  how this had \\nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the pa rents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others. Of \\ncourse, by his merit of music, in July 2007, he performed in the Rashtra pati Bhavan art \\ntheatre. \\n \\nOvercome the impact of disaster through partnership \\nI had the opportunity to experience the Indomitable Spirit of the people  and children of \\nJammu & Kashmir even as they were just recovering from the de vastating earthquake in \\n2005. I visited Urusa village on 26th November 2005 which has been adopted by the  \\nWestern Air Command, Air Force for providing relief and medical aid to the residents of \\nthat area. When I went there, I found that the school building had been severely damaged. \\nI met all the school children and the village citizen of Urusa. The villagers apprised me of \\ntheir losses and had all praise for Army and Air Force role in rescue and relief operations \\nalong with state government.

Our Defence \\nForces are in a beautiful mission. When the nation sleeps during night , Members of our \\nDefence teams are awake to guard us and remain vigilant to counte r any threat.

I talke d to Ms. Padma, a student \\nleader from Andhra Pradesh Tribal Welfare School, Nalgonda who relat ed how she \\nweaned her father away from smoking after imbibing the spirit of  the 10 point oath from \\nthe Lead India Training Camp. This gives me an assurance that the  youth of our country \\nare on the right path \\nthrough this mission oriented programme.

      "Speech:The speech is the departing speech of A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, the former President of India, after completing his five-year tenure at Rashtrapati Bhavan. He expresses his gratitude to the people of India and shares his experiences, highlighting 10 important messages that he learned during his tenure. These messages include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Accelerating development to meet the aspirations of the youth\n",
      "2. Empowering villages\n",
      "3. Mobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness\n",
      "4. Focusing on agricultural growth\n",
      "5. Defeating problems and succeeding\n",
      "6. Overcoming problems through partnership\n",
      "7. Showing courage in combating calamities\n",
      "8. Promoting connectivity for societal transformation\n",
      "9. Defending the nation\n",
      "10. Encouraging a youth movement for a developed India by 2020\n",
      "\n",
      "He starts elaborating on the first message, \"Accelerate Development: Aspiration of the youth\", by sharing a story of a young girl named Anukriti who asked him why India cannot become a developed nation before 2020. He appreciated her question and assured her that it was a thoughtful one, setting the stage for his further discussion on this topic.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker appreciated the question, found it thoughtful, and assured the person that their dream would be taken to the highest national institution and worked on.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses the aspirations of Indian youth to live in a developed and prosperous India. The speaker reflects on their experiences visiting villages, including a trip to Nagaland, where they saw the positive impact of empowered village councils. They highlight the need for physical connectivity, such as quality roads, to enable faster movement of products from villages to markets. The speaker also mentions the \"Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas\" (PURA) initiative, which aims to provide physical, electronic, and knowledge connectivity to rural areas, leading to economic connectivity and employment generation. The overall theme is the importance of empowering villages and providing opportunities for rural development to create a prosperous and proud India.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses the success of a rural development model, Periyar PURA, which has generated employment and created entrepreneurs through the support of self-help groups. The model has transformed 200 acres of waste land into cultivable land, promoting sustainable economic development through activities such as cultivation, bio-mass power generation, and food processing. Additionally, the project has collaborated with international experts to develop 55 lifestyle products, enhancing the innovative abilities of the local people. The speaker suggests that this model can be replicated to bridge the rural-urban divide, estimating that 7000 such projects are needed across the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker shares two inspiring experiences. Firstly, they met with over 6,000 farmers from different states and union territories who visited Rashtrapati Bhavan, showcasing their interest in various gardens and interacting with horticultural specialists. The speaker emphasizes the need to double agricultural production with reduced resources and improve the nation's economic conditions through the \"Seed to Food\" principle. They express confidence in the nation's potential to increase agricultural GDP growth by 4% per annum through partnerships between farmers, scientists, and industries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, the speaker recounts a meeting with Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, a person born without hands and legs, who despite his physical limitations, exudes confidence and happiness. The speaker is inspired by Murthy's positive attitude and his desire to sing, rather than seeking help or assistance. The encounter is a testament to the human spirit's ability to overcome challenges and succeed. The speaker's overall message is one of empowerment, resilience, and the importance of defeating problems to achieve success.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses two inspiring stories of overcoming challenges. The first story is about a physically challenged person who, despite his disability, has developed a talent for music with the support of his parents, teachers, and others. He has even performed at the Rashtra Pati Bhavan art theatre, demonstrating his perseverance and positive attitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second story is about the people of Urusa village in Jammu & Kashmir, who were recovering from a devastating earthquake in 2005. The speaker visited the village and witnessed the indomitable spirit of the people, who were grateful for the relief and medical aid provided by the Air Force and the state government. Despite their losses, the villagers showed courage and resilience, becoming masters of their problems rather than being controlled by them. The speech highlights the importance of partnership and support in overcoming challenges and achieving success.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses the speaker's experiences with people's courage and resilience in the face of natural disasters and challenges. The speaker recalls visiting a village after an earthquake, where they saw children and villagers participating in relief operations with the Armed Forces, and witnessed the government providing relief grants to victims. The speaker also shares their experience visiting the Car Nicobar Islands after the 2004 tsunami, where they met with tribal council leaders and were inspired by the community's courage and generosity in taking in affected victims as their own. The speaker composed a poem, \"Sea Waves,\" which they sang with the villagers, and notes the community's enthusiasm and courage despite their suffering. The speech also mentions the speaker's address to the Pan African Parliament, but the summary is cut off before further details are provided. Overall, the speech highlights the importance of human courage and resilience in the face of adversity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses the proposal for a Pan African e-Network, a $100 million project to connect 53 African countries through a seamless and integrated network. The project aims to link 12 universities, 17 super specialty hospitals, 53 tele-medicine centers, and 53 tele-education centers across Africa. A pilot project has already been launched in Ethiopia, with Indian universities and hospitals providing tele-education and tele-medicine services to Ethiopian students and patients.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses three main topics: \n",
      "\n",
      "1. **India's global collaborations**: The speaker mentions India's collaboration with Africa, specifically a tele-consultation program between Hyderabad and a hospital in Addis Ababa, and a plan to connect 53 African countries through a Pan African network.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Defending the nation**: The speaker expresses pride in India's defense forces, sharing personal experiences of visiting the Siachen Glacier, being on a submarine, and flying in a fighter jet. They acknowledge the sacrifices and dedication of India's soldiers, sailors, and air warriors.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Youth movement for Developed India 2020**: The speaker mentions meeting a group of citizens in Hyderabad who are working towards transforming the youth into enlightened citizens, as part of the \"Lead India 2020 Foundation\", with the goal of developing India by 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses the importance of transforming India's youth into enlightened citizens. It highlights the work of the Lead India 2020 Foundation, which is training thousands of students in Andhra Pradesh in partnership with the district administration. The speaker cites examples of the positive impact of this training, including improved self-discipline, love for parents and teachers, and a sense of duty towards the nation. The speaker believes that empowering the 540 million youth below the age of 25 through value-based education and leadership is crucial for the country's progress. The speech concludes by emphasizing the richness of India's tradition and the efforts being made by various agencies to promote cultural diversity and unity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech emphasizes the importance of preserving India's cultural heritage and natural resources while pursuing economic growth. The speaker expresses confidence that India can become a developed nation by 2020, driven by the power of its 540 million youth. The speech highlights the need for a collective effort to empower citizens and create a more equitable society. The speaker outlines a vision for a developed India with five key characteristics:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Reduced rural-urban divide\n",
      "2. Equitable distribution of energy and water\n",
      "3. Harmonious coexistence of agriculture, industry, and service sectors\n",
      "4. Access to education with a value system for all, regardless of socio-economic background\n",
      "5. A destination for top talent from around the world\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech concludes on a note of optimism, encouraging citizens to work together to achieve this vision and reminding them that with determination and hard work, anything is possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech describes a vision for a ideal nation with the following characteristics:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Access to quality healthcare for all\n",
      "* Good governance that is responsive, transparent, and corruption-free\n",
      "* Elimination of poverty, illiteracy, and crimes against women and children\n",
      "* A prosperous, healthy, secure, peaceful, and happy society with sustainable growth. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the speech paints a picture of a utopian society where all citizens have access to basic necessities and live in a safe and harmonious environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech is a conclusion by Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, where he thanks the citizens for their support and cooperation over the last five years. He shares his mission to unite the hearts and minds of India's multicultural society and instill self-confidence. He expresses his commitment to helping India become a developed nation by 2020 and ends with a blessing and a patriotic note, \"Jai Hind\" (Victory to India).\n",
